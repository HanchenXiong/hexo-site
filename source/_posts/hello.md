* *number of participants*: 
* *number of sponsors*:
* *number of submissions*:
* *number of accepted papers*:
* *number of workshops*:
* *number of tutorials*:

besides these, a KDD cup competition, as usual, is organized. Interestingly, this year all awards are dominated by Chinese teams, probably due to that the competition sponsor and its test is very China-oriented.
